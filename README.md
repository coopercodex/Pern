  ## Introduction

   This is a full-stack web application. It helped to solidify my understanding of how the front-end and back-end relationship works. Click the deployed link and add or edit a note to the community. 

  ## Technologies

  - JavaScript
  - React
  - Redux
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - PostgreSQL
  - Express
  - Material UI


  ## Features

  This application allows users to do full CRUD operations with a Vite/React powered front-end and uses PostgreSQL with Express.js for the back-end. The state of the app is controlled by Redux.

  ## Possible Future Extensions

  Some future extensions that I would like add to this application is to add a way to make new note components and for users to optimize the UI. 

  ## Set Up
  
  1. Fork and clone this repo.
  2. Type `cd` to move into the root directory.
  3. Run `nodemon index` in the terminal to fire up the sever.
  4. Open a second terminal and type `cd client` to move into the client directory.
  4. Run `npm run dev` in the terminal to see the html page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. Have Fun!
